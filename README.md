# RecapTime.dev meta hub

Welcome to RecapTime.dev projects on sourcehut and our workboard public issue tracker over at mau.dev!

## Suggestions? Have an issue? Questions?

There are many ways you can contact us, especially if you don't know where to direct your inquiry.

### General Purpose

Remember that once you create a issue on either side, we'll automagically create on the other side for you, but in meanwhile, we'll handle that for you on per-issue basis.

* If you prefer GitLab, sign in to `mau.dev` using your GitHub or GitLab SaaS account and go file a new issue. (Prefers email? Use the Service Desk address `git.incoming+recaptime-squad-issue-tracker-208-issue-@mau.dev` when sending one.)
* If you prefer sourcehut-styled issue trackers without JS bloat, submit one over <https://todo.sr.ht/~recaptime-dev/squad-suggestion-box> (or via email at `~recaptime-dev/squad-suggestion-box@todo.sr.ht`).
* Mailing lists might not be covered, but if you want to, just hit our public inbox an snag at `~recaptime-dev/public-inbox@lists.sr.ht`.
