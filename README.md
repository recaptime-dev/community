# General organizational work issue tracker for @recaptime-dev/squad

*Looking for the org README? You should probably go [here for general info](https://mau.dev/RecapTime/gitlab-profile/blob/readmemain/README.md) and [here for the crew](https://mau.dev/RecapTime/squad/gitlab-profile/blob/main/README.md)*

## Where to file tickets/issues?

We compile the places where to file tickets for different purposes, especially project specifics and stuff specific to internal operations of the organization.

**Note**: Remember that once you create a issue on either side (GitLab or sourcehut for open-source and public work + JetBrains Space for internal tracking on some),
we'll automagically create on the other side for you, but in meanwhile, we'll handle that for you on per-issue basis.

### General Org Work

We use this repo's issue tracker to track general organizational work that affects everything Recap Time Squad, ranging from how do we run and operate, our goverance policies, and more.

* If you prefer GitLab, sign in to `mau.dev` using your GitHub or GitLab SaaS account and go file a new issue. (Prefers email? ~~Use the Service Desk address `git.incoming+recaptime-dev-squad-issue-tracker-208-issue-@mau.dev` when sending one.~~ Apparently, we don't know why we can't receive issues via Service Desk in this instance. Please use the sourcehut todo way instead.)
* If you prefer sourcehut-styled issue trackers without JS bloat, submit one over <https://todo.sr.ht/~recaptime-dev/squad-suggestion-box> (or via email at `~recaptime-dev/squad-suggestion-box@todo.sr.ht`).

### Community

TBD

### Squad Specifics

* Need access to things like the Internal Squad Wiki or even join our tailnet for work? Go to the [Access Requests](https://mau.dev/recaptime-dev/access-requests/issues) issue tracker.

### Project-specifics

TL;DR: Check the project's README and contributor's documentation for details about their issue tracker.
